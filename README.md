# sound-similarity

This project is implemented by Arvin Arasteh, Ramon Deniz, and Ryley Lamb at Arizona State University.

This newly proposed sound similarity technique can be used to 
1) Assist music services to find more songs that their users might like, 
2) Assist different law services to determine whether two kinds of music violate copyright laws (finding plagiarized work), and 
3) Assist music services to build a recommendation model.
